# CLAUDE.md — Apo-JVyduna package

Claude Code guidance for Jeff Vyduna's `apotheneum.jvyduna.*` Chromatik package.
This repo is personal, so these notes live directly in `CLAUDE.md` — no more
`CLAUDE.notes.md` + gitignored-stub indirection from the fork days.

## Package Overview

The `apotheneum.jvyduna` package contains patterns and audio work by Jeff Vyduna
for the Apotheneum LED installation.

Jeff's goal is to compose a 20 minute piece for Apotheneum that is tightly
choreographed to the music in `audio/songs/`. At the same time he uses the beta
`arrange` branch of LXStudio (and LX/GLX) to provide helpful feedback on new
features that allow artists to compose timeline-based compositions in Chromatik,
as an alternative to the Ableton-based workflows most artists currently use.

## Repo relationships

- **This repo** (`~/Code/jvyduna/Apo-JVyduna`) — the LX package: patterns, utils,
  design docs. Most development happens here. Builds
  `jvyduna-apotheneum-<version>.jar` into `~/Chromatik/Packages`.
- **`~/Code/Apotheneum`** (fork of Apotheneum/Apotheneum) — upstream code plus
  `.lxp` project files only (`src/main/resources/projects/jvyduna/`). PRs to
  upstream are `.lxp`-only. Its `pom.xml` stays pristine at upstream's
  `lx.version` (1.2.1); the arrange override happens at build invocation (below).
- **Host app from source** — `~/Code/mcslee/LXStudio` + `~/Code/heronarts/LX` +
  `~/Code/heronarts/GLX`, all on branch `arrange`, all `1.2.2-SNAPSHOT`.

## Layout

- `src/main/java/apotheneum/jvyduna/patterns/` — pattern classes
- `audio/` (repo root, gitignored) — audio assets used while developing/performing
  (e.g. `audio/songs/`), ~258 MB of copyrighted reference tracks. Excluded via the
  committed `.gitignore`; never `git add` audio.
- Design docs live next to the code they describe, as `<PatternName>.md` in the
  same directory as the `.java` file.

## Git workflow

- Claude Code sessions develop in worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/` on
  `worktree-bridge-*` branches; the repo root stays on `main`.
- **Minimal remote activity.** When a turn of improvements is done, merge it
  back into the **local** `main` branch. Do not push worktree branches, create
  remote branches, or open PRs; `git push` of main happens only when Jeff asks.
- **Rebase on main at the start of every turn.** Before making new edits, run
  `git rebase main` in the worktree so the session builds on the latest merged
  state and current CLAUDE.md. Only rebase a clean tree — commit (or stash)
  first, never mid-edit. Worktree branches are single-session and local-only,
  so rebasing is always safe here.
- Keep each session scoped to its own pattern's files. Shared utils
  (`SurfaceCanvas`, `AudioReactive`, `TempoLock`) are the conflict hotspot:
  keep util edits small and additive, call them out in the merge commit body,
  and merge finished turns promptly so other sessions pick them up on their
  next rebase.
- When a session's work is approved: commit it on the worktree branch with a
  descriptive message summarizing the curation pass, then merge into main
  from the repo root with a merge commit —
  `git -C ~/Code/jvyduna/Apo-JVyduna merge --no-ff <branch> -m "Merge <what> into main"` —
  noting in the body any file overlap with other recent sessions.
- After merging, rebuild on main (`mvn -Pinstall clean install`) so the
  deployed jar in `~/Chromatik/Packages` matches main.
- Leave local `.idea/` drift in the repo root uncommitted unless asked.
- Never `git add` audio (see Layout).

## Reference skills

- **`te-patterns`** (personal skill) — idioms for writing native-Java LX/Chromatik
  patterns, distilled from the TitanicsEnd team's example code. Useful cross-repo
  reference when authoring Apotheneum patterns (same LX framework; different
  geometry). It should surface automatically for pattern work; invoke it
  explicitly if it doesn't.

## Preferences

- **Avoid custom UI; prefer the default auto-generated control panel.** Patterns
  should rely on Chromatik's automatic UI — just register parameters with
  `addParameter(...)` — and should **not** implement `UIDeviceControls` /
  `buildDeviceControls` unless absolutely necessary. If custom UI is ever truly
  required, keep **max 3 controls per column**.
- Use `LX.log("...")` for debugging output, not `System.out.println` (println
  won't appear in `~/Chromatik/Logs`).
- Build/deploy with `mvn -Pinstall install` (not just `mvn compile` — patterns
  load from the deployed jar).
- No `new` allocations in render loops; reuse collections.

## Debugging against the `arrange` LXStudio build

The host app is launched **from source in IntelliJ** and this project loads into
it as a **package jar**. Package vs. host: this project is a plugin;
LXStudio/GLX/LX are the host.

Setup (one-time, in IntelliJ):
- One IntelliJ window rooted at **this repo**, with LXStudio, LX, GLX, and
  Apotheneum attached as Maven projects (`Add Maven Project` on each `pom.xml`)
  so breakpoints bind across the whole stack from source.
- The committed shared run config **"Chromatik (arrange)"**
  (`.idea/runConfigurations/Chromatik.xml`) does the full cycle:
  1. builds the Apotheneum fork with `install -Pinstall
     -Dlx.version=1.2.2-SNAPSHOT` (the `-D` override targets the arrange host
     while the fork's committed pom stays at upstream's 1.2.1 — the old
     committed-lx.version-bump policy is RETIRED),
  2. builds this package with `install -Pinstall`,
  3. launches `heronarts.lx.studio.Chromatik` from source (module `glxstudio`,
     Temurin 21, `-XstartOnFirstThread`, `--warnings`, working dir
     `~/Code/mcslee/LXStudio`).

Iteration loop (the important part):
- **Patterns register from the deployed jar, not IntelliJ's compiled module
  classes.** After editing, rerun the "Chromatik (arrange)" config (or
  `mvn -Pinstall install` + restart). Editing source alone will NOT update the
  running app.
- **Keep only one `jvyduna-apotheneum-*.jar` in `~/Chromatik/Packages`.** LX
  loads packages alphabetically and the first-loaded class wins; a leftover
  older-versioned jar shadows the current build (log: "Ignoring duplicate
  class"). Delete stale jars. Same rule applies to the upstream
  `apotheneum-*.jar`.
- **Quit any standalone Chromatik.app before launching from IntelliJ** — a
  second instance grabs the OSC port ("[OSC] ... Address already in use") and
  reads the same Packages dir.
- Keep this pom's `<lx.version>` matching the arrange host (currently
  `1.2.2-SNAPSHOT`). `lx.package`'s `lxVersion` is filtered from it; a stale
  value triggers a "built for an older version" warning at load.
